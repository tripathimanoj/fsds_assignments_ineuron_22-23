The left and top values are the coordinates of the upper-left corner of the region, while the right and bottom values are the coordinates of the lower-right corner of the region. The box tuple is used to define the region of an image to crop, copy, or paste, among other operations. For example, the box tuple `(0, 0, 100, 100)` represents a rectangular region with the upper-left corner at (0,0) and the lower-right corner at (100,100)."
