    "For example, in a manufacturing process, the target function could be to minimize production costs while maintaining a certain level of product quality. In this case, the function would take into account factors such as the cost of raw materials, labor, and equipment, as well as the quality control measures needed to ensure that the final product meets certain standards.\n",

    "The fitness of a target function is assessed by measuring how well it achieves the desired outcome. In optimization problems, this is typically done by comparing the output of the function for different solutions and selecting the one that performs the best. Fitness can be assessed using a variety of metrics, depending on the specific problem being solved. For example, in the manufacturing example above, fitness could be assessed based on the cost of production, the quality of the final product, or some combination of the two."

Accuracy measures the proportion of correct predictions, precision measures the proportion of true positives among the predicted positives, recall measures the proportion of true positives among the actual positives, and F1 score is the harmonic mean of precision and recall.
